## Event resources:

All funding for this event has been provided by Watford Trusted Banking Ltd with a budget of £3000 for hiring the venue and other resources necessary, the venue has provided InforTech with a climate controlled conference room equipped with computers that are connected to the internet with room for up to 20 people, however the computers cost InfoTech for each one used at a charge of £20 per computer. The venue will also provide fruit drinks, tea, coffee, fresh fruit, various flavoured waters including cucumber and lemon and hard boiled mints at no extra cost as Jurys Inn provides these amenities for every customer. The venue will also provide refrigerators for the catering to be stored. This event location was chosen for its close proximity to Watford Junction Train Station and its central location within Watford Town Centre.

InfoTech was originally planning to use Pret A Manger for catering. However, after recent events the company decided to go with Costco catering instead, they provide sandwich platters at a reasonable and cheaper price with great variety including both vegetarian and vegan options. Required to order 48 hours in advance. They are currently not accepting online orders, orders have to be placed in store.

Travel expenses including transport to and from the venue and also to collect the sandwiches from Costco have been taken into account. Preparation of the Kahoot quiz was provided by InfoTech staff, Kahoot is a free service. Google slides is used to create the presentation. GMail is used to show how easily the name of an email can be changed.
